# what3words Elixir wrapper

Use the what3words API in your Elixir app (see [the API documentation](http://developer.what3words.com/api)). 🚀


## Installation

Pretty straightforward! Add the dependency to your `mix.exs`:
```
  def deps do
    [{:what3words, "~> 1.0.0"}]
  end
```

and add your API key to your `config.exs` (get one [here](https://map.what3words.com/register?dev=true)):
```
config :what3words, key: "mykey"
```

You should be good to go! 👏🏻
